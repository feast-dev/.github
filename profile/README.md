## Overview

Feast (**Fea**ture **St**ore) is an [open-source](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast) feature store that helps teams 
operate production ML systems at scale by allowing them to define, manage, validate, and serve features for production 
AI/ML.

Feast's feature store is composed of two foundational components: (1) an offline store 
for historical feature extraction used in model training and an (2) online store
for serving features at low-latency in production systems and applications.

Our main repository is the [Feast repo](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast) licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme).
